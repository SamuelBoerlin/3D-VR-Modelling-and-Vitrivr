## 3D Sculpting in VR integrated with the [Vitrivr](https://github.com/vitrivr)/[Cineast](https://github.com/vitrivr/cineast) multimedia content retrieval system

Main repository for our Modern Human-Machine Interaction Seminar project at the University of Basel.
This project allows the user to sculpt shapes and models using VR equipment and basic CSG operations.  
Sculptures can then be used to query Cineast for similar models in its database, and the results are shown in-game as interactable objects.
Additionally those query result objects can be voxelized and then modified using the sculpting tools, or be used to query for more
similar objects.
